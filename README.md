# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
###  Technologies:-OCR,streamlit GUI, SQL,Data Extraction

Through this project I have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
